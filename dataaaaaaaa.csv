Each government initiative focuses on building sustainable assets that not only result in extensive connectivity, robust infrastructure, rural and urban renewal but also generate jobs and aid human capital development. These programmes constitute the foundation for the 21st-century India, moulding the vision of a New India, rapidly progressing towards the realization of the goal of becoming a 'Viksit Bharat' (Developed India).

All of this transcends the concept of transactional welfarism. It is about creating a virtuous cycle of economic demand via empowerment of individuals cutting across lines of caste, class, community, religion and gender, according to a blog on Modi’s website which explains his economic policy.

It is about establishing conditions for growth that are both sustainable and egalitarian. embodying the principle of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas aur Sabka Prayas' as stated by the Prime Minister.

PM Modi’s inclusive developmental paradigm stands vindicated today. Along with the growth in our GDP, the government has been able to lift 13.5 crore people out of poverty -- an unprecedented achievement. Globally, the model has ensured that India maintains its developmental streak even as countries like China show vulnerability, the blog said.

PM Modi’s GDP plus Welfare Model is a formidable recipe for a formidable India -- an India which is Atmanirbhar and Viksit.

Exceeding all expectations and predictions, India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has demonstrated a remarkable annual growth of 7.6% in the second quarter of FY2024. Building on a strong first-quarter growth of 7.8%, the second quarter has outperformed projections with a growth rate of 7.6%.

A significant contributor to this growth has been the government's capital expenditure, reaching Rs. 4.91 trillion (or $58.98 billion) in the first half of the fiscal year, surpassing the previous year's figure of Rs 3.43 trillion. India has emerged as an outstanding performer among major economies, showcasing resilience in the face of a globally uncertain environment characterized by risks related to geopolitical conflicts, fluctuating energy prices, and concerns about a potential recession.

This impressive milestone further substantiates the country’s unique development paradigm. A paradigm, that has been a hallmark of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in the last 9 years, set to leave an inspiring trail for other developing nations to follow, it said.

The GDP, in itself, has been an incomplete measure of development as it overlooks inequality amid growth.

However, once PM Modi took office in 2014, growth intertwined with welfare to revolutionize the Indian economic experience. The fruits of the shift are visible today as India continues to be the fastest growing major economy even as the global headwinds don’t show much promise, it said.

PM Modi’s GDP Plus Welfare model has worked wonders for a country that had been long deprived of even the basic amenities of life. This success can be attributed to a departure from the previous governments’ approach to welfare, which primarily involved handouts, loan write-offs, or the distribution of consumer goods.

Taking a leaf out of his development initiatives in Gujarat, PM Modi focused on building fundamental public infrastructure first, empowering individuals to act as agents of change, the blog said.

“We have seen this approach in government schemes like SAUBHAGYA, Jal Jeevan Mission, PM Awas Yojana, and PM Gram Sadak Yojana, among others. Today we have achieved 100% electrification of villages while over 13.7 crore tap water connections make water available to 70% of our families from only 17% about a decade ago.

""In addition, PM Modi’s government has sanctioned over 4 crore houses towards its guarantee of Housing for All. The Swachh Bharat Mission has successfully constructed over 11.7 crore toilets, contributing to improved sanitation nationwide. In 2014, barely half of the villages had all-weather road connectivity, but today, the number has surged to over 99%,"" the blog said.

Going beyond the fundamental needs, the government since 2014 has taken transformative measures to augment economic activity in every possible way. In manufacturing, for example, initiatives like Make in India, Production-Linked Incentive schemes, along with labour reforms have greatly energized overall industrial sentiment.

Today, as the data suggests, manufacturing has achieved a real GVA growth of 13.9% in Q2 of FY2024 against 4.7% in Q1. PMI Manufacturing continues to expand, reaching 55.5 in October 2023.

The services sector has also performed well registering a jump of 5.8%, driven by robust financial, public administration and professional services. The construction sector, in particular, is performing exceptionally well, jumping from 7.9% in Q1 to 13.3% in Q2 as the government increased its capex by over 40%.

In addition, schemes like PM Fasal Bima Yojana, PM KISAN, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, PM Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, and e-NAM are actively supporting, modernizing and changing the face of Indian agriculture, the blog said. PM Modi has been heavily committed to charting the trajectory for Bharat to become a developed country by 2047.

His further push towards building long-term infrastructure finds momentum via AMRUT, Smart Cities, Vande Bharat trains, industrial and freight corridors along with Sagarmala and Bharatmala.

These bona fide interventions are powered by PM Gati Shakti and National Infrastructure Pipeline that aim to simplify and integrate planning, and funding of infrastructural activity in the country respectively, the blog said.

In a report on India’s transformation in less than a decade, foreign brokerage Morgan Stanley noted, “This India is different from what it was in 2013. In a short span of 10 years, India has gained positions in the world order with significant positive consequences for the macro and market outlook”.

Morgan Stanley listed the 10 big changes including supply-side policy reforms, formalisation of the economy, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, digitalizing social transfers, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, flexible inflation targeting, focus on FDI, India's 401(k) moment, government support for corporate profits and MNC sentiment at a multiyear high.

As India's per capita income increases from US$2,200 currently to about US$5,200 by F2032, this will have major implications for change in the consumption basket, with an impetus to discretionary consumption, Morgan Stanley said.

The share of profits in GDP has doubled from all-time lows hit in 2020 and are set to rise further – maybe even double from here – leading to strong absolute and relative earnings.

This explains India's apparently rich headline equity valuations. Triggered by supply-side reforms by the government, we expect a major rise in investments, a moderation in the CAD and an increase in credit to GDP to support the coming profit growth, it added.

families of the victims of the Morbi bridge collapse incident said the public prosecutor's conduct in court was ""spine chilling"". (PTI file photo)

The families of the victims of the Morbi bridge tragedy wrote a letter to the Prime Minister’s office, Union Law Minister's office and Gujarat Chief Minister’s office seeking the removal of additional advocate general and public prosecutor Mitesh Amin from the case.

The 'Tragedy Victim Association of Morbi' comprising families of 111 people who died in the incident demanded Amin's removal for not opposing the bail of Oreva Group Managing Director Jaysukh Patel, who is the prime accused in the case.

The case pertains to the collapse of the century-old suspension bridge which plunged into Gujarat's Macchu River on October 30, 2022. The tragedy claimed 135 lives.

Jaysukh Patel is the promoter of Ajanta Oreva Group, the company responsible for the operation and maintenance of the bridge.

The Gujarat High Court on December 13 reserved its verdict on the bail plea filed by Jaysukh Patel after public prosecutor Mitesh Amin submitted that the matter is up to the discretion of the court. Amin had told the court that there was ""no possibility"" of Patel running away since he is a businessman.

The families of the victims said it was ""completely surprising and spine-chilling"" that the public prosecutor adopted a ""loose and stigmatic approach while representing the State of Gujarat"".

""It would not be out of the place to say that the arguments commenced by Shri Amin also reflected the stands of the State Government, which seems to be completely contrary to what had been promised,"" added the families.

The association added that contrary to the prosecutor's attitude in court, the state government and the central government in October 2022 made ""staunch promises"" that no stones would be left unturned in the investigation in the case. It added that the families of the victims had high hopes from the prosecution ""due to continuous assurances"" by the state government that a strict approach would be adopted against the perpetrators of the incident.

Jaysukh Patel is facing charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including culpable homicide, acts endangering human life, and rash or negligent acts.

He also lauded the central government’s schemes that have provided ₹17,000 crore life insurance cover to the poor. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the beneficiaries of 'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra' via video conferencing, in New Delhi. (ANI)

The Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra was launched across the country on November 15 to attain saturation of flagship schemes of the government by ensuring that the benefits of these schemes reach all the targeted beneficiaries in a time bound manner. The yatra, flagged off from Khunti in Jharkhand, aims to cover 260,000 gram panchayats and over 4,000 urban local bodies across the nation by January 25, 2024.

“Within a month the Viksit Bharat Yatra has covered 1,000 villages and covered 1,500 cities among which most are small towns… It is evident that the public is excited about it and it has come to the fore that the Viksit Bharat vans are being welcomed uniquely everywhere it goes. I urge more people to join in and I guarantee that the Visit Bharat vans will help you in the process. Modi’s guarantee vehicle (Visit Bharat IEC vans) is empowering more and more youth and women, I want people to avail benefit of this yatra,” Modi said while addressing the beneficiaries of the yatra through video conferencing.

During the event, the PM also flagged off the Yatra in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram — the five states where assembly elections were held recently. The scheme could not be launched in these states in adherence to the model code of conduct.

Hailing the welfare schemes launched by his government, Modi also took a swipe at “some political parties” who were “busy making headlines and news”.

“Our government has provided life insurance protection in the tune of ₹17,000 crore through the PM Suraksha Bima Yojana and PM Jivan Jyoti Yojana. Can you imagine who much it would benefit those who lost their loved ones? Some political parties when they initiate a 200-400 crore scheme, they are busy in making headlines and news. But we have already deposited ₹17,000 crore in medical claims to poor people. I urge more people to join in and I guarantee that the Visit Bharat vans will help you in the process. Modi’s guarantee vehicle (Visit Bharat IEC vans) is empowering more and more youth and women, I want people to avail benefit of the Viksit Bharat Yatra,” he said. The PM Suraksha Bima Yojana and PM Jivan Jyoti Yojana were launched in 2015.

Modi also interacted with beneficiaries from various states who have availed various government schemes.

One beneficiary, Kalyani Rajbongshi from Guwahati in Assam, shared her experience of mobilising 3,000 people to form self help groups (SHGs) that provided employment to other women using the loans provided by central government schemes. “I am glad that you have employed other women as well. Empowering a woman benefits society,” Modi replied to her.

Talking to a beneficiary of PM Awas Yojana, Kushala Devi from Himachal Pradesh, Modi said people like her inspired the government to work harder.

During the event, the PM also highlighted his government’s focus on developing Tier 2 and 3 cities.

“Under the Amrit Mission or SMART City Mission, basic facilities are being improved in the small cities. We are trying to ensure that facilities like water supply, drainage, sewage system, traffic system, CCTV network etc are upgraded constantly. Cleanliness, public toilets, and LED street lights are also being worked upon for the first time on this level.

When His Majesty the Sultan’s motorcade entered the gate of the Presidential Palace, it was greeted by a group of knights, while the artillery fired a 21-gun salute to His Majesty.

Upon arrival of His Majesty the Sultan’s motorcade in the palace courtyard, President Droupadi Murmu of the Republic of India, and Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, were at the forefront of the welcoming party. They wished His Majesty the Sultan and his official delegation a pleasant stay.

After that, commemorative photos were taken of His Majesty the Sultan, the Indian President and the Indian Prime Minister.

His Majesty the Sultan headed to the dais of honour, where the national anthems of the two countries were played, followed by His Majesty inspecting a guard of honour that lined up to greet him. Then, His Majesty the Sultan shook hands with senior members of the welcoming party.

His Majesty the Sultan held a meeting at Hyderabad House in New Delhi with PM Modi. The meeting affirmed the strength of Omani-Indian relations and the importance of developing these in a manner that further achieves the aspirations of the friendly peoples of the two countries.

In this joint vision, concrete action points have been agreed upon in ten different areas. I am confident that the joint vision will give a new and modern shape to our partnership.”

He added, “I am happy that the discussion on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement is going on and two rounds of discussions have been successfully completed, in which many important issues have been agreed upon. I hope that we will soon be able to sign this agreement which will add a new dimension to our economic cooperation.”

Terming H M the Sultan’s maiden state visit as ‘historic’, PM Modi said, “I am happy to welcome you to India. Today is a historic day in Oman-India relations as after 26 years, the Sultan of Oman has come to India on a state visit and I have got the opportunity to welcome you. On behalf of the people of India, I welcome you.”

He also congratulated Oman for qualifying for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by the West Indies and the US next year.
